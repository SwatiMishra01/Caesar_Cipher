🔐 **Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool: **
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest methods of encryption. It involves shifting each character in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This project provides a user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding text using the Caesar Cipher method, with additional features to handle different character sets, maintain letter case, and support custom alphabets.

📌 Overview
This web-based Caesar Cipher tool allows users to easily transform their messages into encoded text or decode encrypted messages back into readable plaintext. It is ideal for educational purposes, cryptographic experiments, or anyone interested in classical encryption techniques.

The interface consists of three main panels:
* Controls – Configure cipher settings such as encode/decode mode, shift key, modulo, alphabet, case handling, and foreign character options.
* Plaintext – Input area where users type the original message they want to encrypt or decrypt.
* Ciphertext – Output area that displays the resulting encoded or decoded message.

🧠 How It Works
In a Caesar Cipher, each character in the input string is shifted by a certain number of positions based on the shift key. For example, with a shift of 3:
* A becomes D
* B becomes E
* C becomes F...and so on.

This tool goes beyond the basic Caesar Cipher by supporting:
- Custom shift key – Any integer value can be used to shift characters.
- Custom modulo – Allows wrapping around a user-defined character set length.
- Custom alphabet – Define your own alphabet including letters, numbers, or symbols.
- Case sensitivity – Option to maintain the original case of letters or convert all characters to a standard case.
- Foreign characters – Decide whether to remove or retain characters that are not part of the defined alphabet.
